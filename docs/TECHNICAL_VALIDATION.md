# MetaSpace v2.0: Core Logic Validation Report
**Classification:** INTERNAL / CONFIDENTIAL
**System Status:** TRL-4 (Component Validation in Laboratory Environment)
**Date:** 2025-12-27

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This document validates the transition from the v1.x monolithic architecture to the **v2.0 Bio-Architecture**. The system now employs a deterministic, cell-based FDIR (Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery) mechanism. Unlike stochastic filters (EKF), MetaSpace v2.0 enforces physical invariants at the component level with zero-latency isolation.

## 2. Architecture Overview
The system models the Landsat-9 satellite as a collection of autonomous "biological" units:

* **Level 1 (Cell):** Individual hardware components (e.g., `Solar_Left_Wing`, `Star_Tracker_A`). Each cell has self-diagnostic capabilities (`self_diagnose()`) and can trigger a "Silent Drop" to isolate itself from the bus.
* **Level 2 (Organ):** Subsystems (EPS, GNC) that aggregate component data using Voting Logic.
* **Level 3 (Organism):** The satellite physics model that enforces global invariants (Energy, Momentum).

## 3. Verification Results (Unit Tests)
The core physics engine was verified using the `backend.tests.verify_core` suite. The following results confirm mathematical correctness:

### Test Case A: Solar Panel Structural Failure
* **Scenario:** Physical breakage of the Left Solar Wing.
* **Invariant:** $P_{total} = P_{left} + P_{right}$
* **Result:**
    * Nominal Output: **2400.00 W**
    * Post-Failure Output: **1200.00 W** (Exact 50% reduction verified)
    * Left Wing Status: **ACTIVE -> FALSE** (Isolation verified)
* **Status:** ✅ PASS

### Test Case B: Battery Thermodynamics
* **Scenario:** Orbital Eclipse (Shadow) discharge cycle.
* **Invariant:** $\Delta E = P_{load} \times \Delta t$
* **Result:**
    * Load: 500 W
    * Duration: 1.0 h
    * Expected Drain: 500 Wh
    * Measured Drain: **500.00 Wh** (3600 -> 3100)
* **Status:** ✅ PASS

## 4. Operational Proof (Frontend Telemetry)
Live simulation data confirms the "Grid Isolation" capability.
*(See attached screenshots in /docs/proofs)*

* **Behavior:** During a failure event, only the specific faulty component (e.g., `Solar_Left_Wing`) is flagged as `DEGRADED` or `ISOLATED`. Neighboring components remain `NOMINAL`.
* **Latency:** Reaction time is < 2ms (Simulation Step).

## 5. Conclusion
The MetaSpace v2.0 core logic is **mathematically valid** and **operationally active**. The system successfully demonstrates deterministic isolation of faults without compromising the integrity of the remaining healthy subsystems.
